🏗️ Repository Structure
The main file and folder organization is as follows. Note the separation between the front-end and back-end components:

.
├── challenge-testing/  # Contains files related to specific tests or challenges.
├── front/              # Primary directory with the front-end source code (HTML, CSS, JS).
├── back/               # Directory for the back-end source code (e.g., server logic, API).
└── .gitignore          # File specifying files that Git should ignore.
🚀 Installation and Local Use
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running:

1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command line and run the following command:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/CMolinaBetancourt/PM2-Gestor_de_Peliculas.git
2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Bash

cd PM2-Gestor_de_Peliculas
3. Run the Application

As this is a full-stack project, you'll typically need to run both the back-end and front-end components.

Back-end: Navigate into the back/ folder and follow the instructions within that directory to start the server (e.g., using node index.js if it's a Node.js server).

Front-end: Navigate into the front/ folder. Open the main HTML file (e.g., index.html) directly in your web browser or, preferably, use a local server extension (like "Live Server" in VS Code) to serve the front-end files.
